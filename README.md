##Project Description

Meal Match is a recipe site that generates recipes based on ingredients the user already has eliminating the time it takes to shuffle through irrelevant recipes. Users can submit their ingredients and get recipes by ingredient percent match. It also tells you how many ingredients match the ingredients in the recipes and how many are still needed.
